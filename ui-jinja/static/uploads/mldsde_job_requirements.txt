About Flieber

With the migration of retail from offline to online, the business dynamics is moving from high volumes and low efficiency to low volumes and high efficiency. As a result, the whole industry is having to adapt to this new reality, including all installed infrastructure, which was prepared for a world where physical stores, distribution centers and full containers were the norm.

Flieber is enabling this change through the use of advanced technology and data analytics to reduce complexity in e-commerce operations. Our platform synchronizes sales velocity, supply-chain operations and inventory management, and our team executes on our client's decisions. The result is more sales, higher margins and more efficient use of capital, all with a fraction of the work.

Welcome to the new way to operate e-commerce businesses!

gdR has partnered with one of global tech's rising stars to build their Toronto office. Our client is changing the game of compute to enable AI and deep learning.

Having raised in excess of $100M venture capital, with industry leading founders, and significant customers (e.g., research labs) that are using their system (it's not just a chip), they are well positioned to grow into an industry leader that's conquered challenges that people have described as impossible.

As an Algorithms Engineer, you'll create high-performance linear-algebra and machine-learning kernels for custom processors on a distributed HW architecture .

This will entail low-level coding and tuning / optimizing to balance performance, compute and memory. Not exactly an opportunity that comes around that often.

The following experience is required :

High performance parallel programming experience.
Strong knowledge of computer architecture fundamentals.
Your work should display a real passion for low-level system details down to the assembly level.
You have programming fluency and extensive experience working in C or C++ and Assembly languages

Date Posted : July 6th, 2020

Closing Date : August 31st, 2020

Role : Team and Project Lead for ML Development Team

Position : Part-time, approximately 5-10 hours per week. Reporting to the Director of Business Operations.

Salary : Hourly, competitive.

Location : Offices are in downtown Toronto, but working remotely exclusively during the Covid-19 pandemic.

For several terms now we’ve employed a team of 4-6 university co-op students with ML backgrounds from varying disciplines (mainly Engineering, Math, and Computer Science) to be our ML Dev Team.

This team develops and trains ML models and helps to build the related business use cases, and now we are looking to expand the team to include a team and project lead to bring focus and mentorship to the students.

The students’ role is largely R&D as they explore options and test solutions to address new ML project requests

from clients. We’re now looking for a resourceful self-starter who can organize and lead the projects, and summarize the progress and development steps for the management team.

While we already have an experienced full-time dev team, their expertise is not in ML and so we’re looking for someone with experience in a mentoring or coaching role that the students can turn to with questions and for guidance, specifically in AI / ML.

Additionally, we’re looking for someone who understands the business side of software development and can translate the students’ technical work into status reports for the client.

The role is part-time and would likely consist of spending both one-one-one time with each student as well as group meetings to project manage their efforts, and would also include reporting to the management team regularly.

A successful candidate could maintain this role in the longer term over multiple co-op terms, helping us to maintain continuity.

There is also the possibility of this becoming a full-time position at some point if it is deemed to be mutually beneficial, and if the opportunity arises to publish findings based on the work performed, we would be in full support of this effort.

Examples of the work underway include predicting unusual patterns in network traffic data sets, using multiple image recognition techniques to build user profiles in order to enhance recommendation engines in an existing business application, and interpreting PDF images for the purpose of extracting data from engineering technical specification diagrams in order to reduce manual data input.

Technical skills REQUIRED :

Experience with TensorFlow
Experience with Python Programming Language
Experience with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data and classes
Knowledge of object-oriented analysis, design, and programming
Familiarity with Linux
Technical skills PREFERRED :

Understanding of deployment steps for custom Machine Learning models hosted on Cloud platforms (Google, AWS, Azure, and Watson)
Familiarity with Flask Web Application framework
Familiarity with Docker containers
Experience using public Cloud technologies programmatically, such as Google GCP and / or Amazon AWS API (services such as Compute, Vision, DLP, EC3, RDS, S3, )
Experience with building Web Service APIs using SOAP and REST-based frameworks
Soft skills REQUIRED :

Experience in leading ML development projects and teams
Ability to manage projects and report regularly on progress and status of all aspects of the development process
Experience in a mentorship role for students working in ML development, for example as a
Ability to summarize development architecture and report on the status and next steps of various components
Ability to understand the business applications of ML projects and thereby help guide the ML Dev team in their research and development tasks
Education REQUIRED :

Minimum requirement is current enrolment in a post-graduate degree program in a related field
